# den-download-link-match-allowed-versions — Organization installers use the highest allowed desktop version

The organization-wide desktop version policy applies to every member who uses the guided installer flow.

1. An admin allows desktop versions 0.17.37 and 0.17.38, while 0.17.39 remains disallowed.

2. A non-admin signs in to the single-organization dashboard and opens the three-step installer flow.

3. Clicking “Download and install” downloads OpenWork 0.17.38—the highest version permitted by the organization.

4. If an admin pins legacy versions 0.17.26 and 0.17.27, the guided installer still downloads v0.17.37—the first release that has installer assets—instead of pointing at the missing v0.17.27 asset.

5. Organizations without version restrictions follow GitHub’s latest published installer release, avoiding draft-release download windows.
